PyTorch Flower Classifier ðŸŒ¸
Overview
This project is a deep learning-based flower classification system built using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of five different types of flowers: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip. The project also includes a web demo built with Flask, allowing users to upload an image and get a prediction in real-time.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Uses a pre-trained ResNet-18 model fine-tuned for flower classification.
Advanced Metrics: Includes not just accuracy but also precision, recall, and F1-score for a more nuanced evaluation.
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed view of the model's performance.
Web Demo: A Flask-based web interface for real-time classification.
Confidence Threshold: Filters out predictions below a certain confidence level, providing more reliable results.
